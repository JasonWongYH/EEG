# convert that data into a GDF (General Data Format) file using the **MNE-Python** library: reading the data, correctly parsing the channels and event markers, and then exporting it.

# The process requires a few data manipulation steps because your CSV file has metadata (the sampling rate) in the header and combines continuous data with event information in the same columns.

# First, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries if you haven't already. MNE uses the `pygdf` library for GDF support.

# ```bash
# pip install mne pandas pygdf
# ```

# 1.  **Load and Prepare Data**:

#       * We first read only the **header line** of your file to find the sampling frequency (`1024Hz`) using a regular expression.
#       * Then, we load the rest of the file into a **pandas DataFrame**.
#       * The first column's name is cleaned up to just `Time`.

# 2.  **Separate Data and Events**:

#       * We identify the columns that contain the continuous signal (from `Channel 1` to `preProcessedEMG`).
#       * The data from these columns is extracted into a NumPy array and **transposed** to fit the `(channels x samples)` shape required by MNE.
#       * We then separately handle the event columns (`Event Id`, etc.) by creating a new DataFrame and dropping any rows that don't contain an event.

# 3.  **Create MNE Info**:

#       * An `mne.Info` object is a container for all the metadata.
#       * We provide it with the **channel names**, the **sampling frequency** we found, and the **channel types**. **Note:** I've assumed the first 90 channels are 'eeg' and the last one is 'emg'. You should adjust this if you know the correct types.

# 4.  **Create Raw Object**:

#       * `mne.io.RawArray` is used to create the main MNE data object from the NumPy data array and the `Info` object.

# 5.  **Add Annotations**:

#       * MNE stores events as `Annotations`. We create this object using the onset times (`Time` column), durations, and descriptions (`Event Id`) from our events DataFrame.
#       * These annotations are then attached to the `raw` object using `raw.set_annotations()`.

# 6.  **Export to GDF**:

#       * Finally, `mne.io.write_raw_gdf()` is called to save the fully assembled `raw` object, including its data and annotations, into a GDF file.
